Novel machine learning approaches are revolutionizing scientific research, but they did not emerge out of the blue. Decades of methodological developments and applications in scientific computing have culminated in a paradigmatic shift in the way science will be conducted in the twenty first century. I am interested in modernizing classical scientific computing approaches, including numerical integration, numerical continuation, and bifurcation analyses, utilizing modern GPU hardware to accelerate analysis of complex dynamical states, including limit cycles, invariant tori, and chaotic attractors. As an active developer for the open source PySINDy package, I am also investigating applications and methodological developments of machine learning system identification algorithms, specifically for the sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy) algorithm. Coupled with novel neural networks in the form of autoencoders, the SINDy approach promises to advance classical applied mathematics approaches by enabling coordinate discovery with interpretable dynamics. I aim to demonstrate this approach on classical systems to advance discovery in pattern formation.
